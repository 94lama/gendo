# Install

## First use
```sh
source ./isntall
```

## Login
Each time the program is run, despite it being already installed on your machine, you need to ensure all data is set properly. You can quickyl do that with
```sh
source ./login
```

The command will setup all needed variables (the keys will be prompted by the user):
- OPENAI_API_KEY


# Packages

## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python
# ai/__init__.py

import sys
import os
import openai

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.  

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.

import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.

```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python

  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.e## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.w## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.x## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python

  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.  

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

```python
# ai/__init__.py

import sys
import os
import openai

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.  

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace. ## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python
# ai/__init__.py

import sys
import os

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.

```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.i## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python
# ai/__init__.py

import sys
import os
import openai

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.P## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.

```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python

```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.u## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python
# ai/__init__.py

import sys
import os
import openai

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```

### What changed

- **Removed**  
  ```python
  from .project import *
  ```
  The `project` sub-module is no longer imported automatically.

- **Why**  
  This makes the package lighter on import and avoids namespace collisions.  

### How to use the `project` module now

If your code depends on anything in `ai.project`, import it explicitly:

```python
# import the entire module
import ai.project

# or pull in just what you need
from ai.project import ProjectLoader, save_project, load_project
```

This change ensures that only the functionality you opt into ends up in your namespace.
## ai/__init__.py

The package initializer has been simplified. It now only pulls in the `agent` module by default; the `project` module must be imported explicitly if you need it.

```python
# ai/__init__.py

import sys
import os
import openai

from .agent import *

# instantiate the OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()

# set the default project based on the OPENAI_PROJECT env var
client.project = os.getenv("OPENAI_PROJECT")
```
